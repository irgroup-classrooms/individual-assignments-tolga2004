# GitHub and Markdown

1. Visit https://www.github.com and sign-up if you do not already have a GitHub account
2. Set up your profile by following these guidelines: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/setting-up-your-profile Make sure to have repository that matches your username and that contains a README file with some information about yourself. You can freely decide about what you want to share with the others and the public. Please remember, you have to use Markdown in order to render the contents properly.
3. Join our GitHub Classroom at https://classroom.github.com/a/cI1TYVmd Select your student ID, a repository will then automatically be created. **Please reach out to us if your name is not in the list!**
4. Create a first file and add Markdown-formatted content, also add a link to your GitHub profile. Add the file in the following directory: `dis08-2024-assignments/labs/01/`: 
   - Create a new markdown file and edit the file with the browser interface. Alternatively, you can clone it, then commit changes, and push them (more about this in two weeks).
   - Add a to do list with things you have heard about today and would like to learn throughout the semester. You can update this list during the semester by checking things you have learned.
   - Add a table that documents the markdown syntax, which you can use as your personal cheat sheet throughout the semester.
   - Add a quote (about data science or sth. more general) that inspires you.
   - Add verbatim code. With a code snippet that is already familiar to you. Alternatively, write Python code that prints "Hello World!".
   - Add three other markdown-formatted contents. Also insert headings with appropriate levels.
