# The Command Line Interface

1. Visit [https://linuxjourney.com/the-shell](https://linuxjourney.com/lesson/the-shell). Read each of the 19 lessons carefully, answer the quizzes (lower right), and also do the exercises (upper right). Please document the questions and your answers, as well as the command line outputs of the exercises in a Markdown-formatted file `linuxjourney.md` and add it to this subfolder. Please remember that you can also document your command line outputs with verbatim code.
2. Visit [https://gitlab.com/slackermedia/bashcrawl](https://gitlab.com/slackermedia/bashcrawl) and learn Linux commands by playing a simple text adventure. Please follow the instructions provided in the README of the `bashcrawl` repository. Once you finish the game, create a file with your command history and add it to this subfolder - for instance, with the help of `history -100 >> bashcrawl.log`. You can also upload a Markdown file that documents your history with verbatim code. Please pay attention that you upload the full history beginning with `cd ./bashcrawl/entrance/` or similar.
